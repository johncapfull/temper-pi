temper-pi
=========

Provider for temper service (temperature monitoring, alarm...) for raspberry pi

Actually it is just my playgound for Python & pi.

Shoutout to Sander Marechal for his [cool script daemon.py](http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/) that turns Python script into linux daemon!
